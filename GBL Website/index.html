        <h1>What is GBL?</h1>
        <p>GBL is a center for mentoring and providing practical skills to people which can enable them to earn a living and become self
          employed. In a country like Uganda, having a degree in a certain discipline is not always enough because many people with degrees still have 
          no jobs.&nbsp;At GBL we strive to curb the problem of unemployment by empowering people especially the youth with practical skills
          that will enable them to start up businesses of their own and escape the clutches of poverty.
        </p>
        <p>Many youth have already been helped to create a future for themselves and they have been able to support themselves from the earnings
          that they get as they put their skills to practice. We are on a journey to impact the lives of many Ugandans and help them escape poverty.
          The courses we offer are hands-on and the people we teach grasp the skills very quickly and the lessons are very interactive as the 
          intructors are very friendly.
